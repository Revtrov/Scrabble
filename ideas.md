left click on tile to bring back to tray


tray bottom left with 
shuffle reset resign skip swap submit

bag middle left
show tile count and tile dictionary

top left show users/game info


for the tray when you hover over a tile the tile moves away so you can drop

they are slots like the board squares but on hover over check 
if the slot contains square if so move the square in slot over toward nearest slot and move and the tiles inbetween too.


tiles must be in one line
so either all i match or all j match

to validate word check ortho dirs until a blank is reached + cur square, check if thats in the word set. if every spoke is either empty or in word set than valid.

points gained in a round = sum of values of words made this round.(words that now contain the newly placed tile)
